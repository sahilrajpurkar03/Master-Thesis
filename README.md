# Master Thesis: **Towards 6G-Driven Sensing: Development of Machine Learning-based Object Detection for Logistics Entities using mmWave Radar Sensor**

---

## ðŸ“„ Thesis Overview

This thesis investigates the potential of mmWave radar sensors for object detection in logistics environments, offering an alternative to traditional camera and LiDAR-based systems. These conventional systems suffer from drawbacks such as high costs, sensitivity to lighting and weather conditions, privacy concerns, and occlusion issues in complex warehouse environments.

To address these limitations, the study integrates the Texas Instruments **IWR6843ISK** mmWave radar sensor into a logistics setting and develops a machine learning-based object detection pipeline. Models such as **YOLOv7**, **Detectron2**, and **OpenPCDet** are trained and evaluated for detecting logistics entities like forklifts, mobile robots, and small load carriers (KLTs). The system is assessed for real-time performance in dynamic and cluttered environments, demonstrating the benefits of radar-based sensingâ€”such as high resolution, environmental robustness, and reliable operation in low-visibility conditions.

This research contributes to the vision of 6G-driven smart logistics by offering a cost-effective, scalable, and privacy-preserving sensing alternative for industrial automation.

## 01. Sensor Integration

This section outlines the integration of the mmWave radar sensor used for data collection. The sensors used are:

- **[IWR6843ISK](https://www.ti.com/tool/IWR6843ISK)**  
- **[MMWAVEICBOOST](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVEICBOOST)**  
by Texas Instruments (TI).

### Flashing the Default Firmware

Begin by flashing the IWR6843ISK with TI's default firmware:  
ðŸ”— **[Download from TI â€“ mmWave SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-SDK)**

#### ðŸ”§ S1 Switch Configuration for Flash Mode

| Mode          | S1.1 | S1.2 | S1.3 | S1.4 | S1.5 | S1.6 |
|---------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Flash Mode    | On   | Off  | On   | On   | Off  | N/A  |

#### ðŸ’» Flashing Steps (Using [UniFlash](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH) on Windows)

1. Launch **UniFlash**.
2. In **New Configuration**, select your device and click **Start**.
3. Go to **Settings & Utilities**:
   - Set the COM port of the **CFG Port**.
4. Go to the **Program** tab:
   - Click **Browse** under *Meta Image 1* and select the `.bin` file.
5. Toggle the **NRST** switch to power cycle the board.
6. Click **Load Image** to flash.

> âœ… Firmware is now successfully flashed.
